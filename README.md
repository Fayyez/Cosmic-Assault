# Cosmic Assault
Cosmic Assault is our version of the famous arcade game, "space invaders", that we have made as the final semester project for the course of Object Oriented Programming in the second semester of our bachelor's degree in software endineering. The game is built in C++ using sfml library for GUI with implementation and usecases for all major concepts of OOP, i.e., multi-level inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and composition.

## Gameplay
Cosmic Assault is an action-packed space shooter game. In this game, you'll navigate your spacecraft through the cosmos while battling formations enemy ships of different kinds and a fearsome boss battle at the end. Your objective is to kill all the enemy formations and survive the big boss battle without letting them exhaust your spacecraft health first.

### controls:
+ **mouse** to click on menu buttons
+ **Arrow Keys** to maneuver your spacecraft
+ **spacebar** to fire at the enemy!
