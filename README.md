# Cosmic Assault
 Cosmic Assault is our version of the famous arcade game, "space invaders", that we have made as the final semester project for the course of Object Oriented Programming in the second semester of our bachelor's degree in software endineering.

## Gameplay
Cosmic Assault is an action-packed space shooter game. In this game, you'll navigate your spacecraft through the cosmos while battling formations enemy ships of different kinds and a fearsome boss battle at the end. Your objective is to kill all the enemy formations and survive the big boss battle without letting them exhaust your spacecraft health first.
